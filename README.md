A selection of useful MaxMSP objects and patches

- [jsui]
  - aleks.multiplot - An upgraded and enhanced version of Timothy Place's plot.js. Plot.js was a simplified an customizable replica of Max' [plot~] object.
  - aleks.multislider (under development) - A modified and customizable version of Max' [multislider] object.
- [js]
  - aleks.scaleUI - Two ways to make the zoom in Max automatically scale based on the window size. In other words, resizing the max window will automatically adjust the zoom.
- [jitter]
  - OpenGL Spectral Iamge Processing - I conducted a small experiment to investigate whether an OpenGL jitter system that generates real-time spectral mean images in Max/MSP/Jitter should do its vector mean calculations on the CPU or the GPU.
